<h3 class="color-secondary"> Personality </h3>
Loki, the Prince of Asgard and rightful heir of Jotunheim is driven by his desire to be king.
Resentful of living in his brother Thor's shadow, Loki studied magical arts earning himself the title of the God of Mischief.Loki was born on Jotunheim as the son of the Frost Giant King, Laufey.
Loki was abandoned by his actual father, Laufey, and left to die due to being born too small for the giantâ€™s liking.
Odin found and adopted the baby without hesitation and took him to Asgard. This information was kept from Loki for about 1000 years, only to be uncovered on the day of Thor's coronation as King. 
Upon realising that he had been lied to by his adopted father, Loki sets on a path to prove his worthiness of the Asgardian throne in place of Thor.
